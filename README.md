# En-Pl-translator
This program uses Microsoft Translator API to translate english words to polish ones, save them in .txt file and eventually create flashcards from the .txt file list.

To use the program one will need to create Microsoft Azure account and get one's own access key to put it in the translator.py file. The API is free if the user of the translator do not exceed 2 000 000 translated characters limit in a month. 

# EDIT!
Microsoft Azure Translator is no longer needed. Now the translation is acquired from diki.pl web dictionary.

# EDIT2!
New flashcards creation tool that generates 2 html files - the first is printer friendly flashcards and the second contains interactive flashcards.
